## statement

Writing this in C was a completely over-the-top and more or less a programming
exercise. Just to make sure that everyone is aware I'm not (totally) insane,
it would be much more convenient to write this in bash or something.

But, if you want a C program to print the status and list all your repos,
here it is!

## usage

Compile the program and run it without any arguments.
